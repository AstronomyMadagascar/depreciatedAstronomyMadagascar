Dear Colleagues,

We are happy to circulate the first announcement of the inaugural Malagasy National Astronomy Meeting scheduled to take place on 13-15 December 2023 in Antananarivo, Madagascar.

Under the theme "Astronomy in Madagascar - the past, present, future", the event is geared towards bringing together Malagasy astronomy community and its key stakeholders to discuss the current status of Astronomy in the country in preparation for the 2024 IAU General Assembly and beyond. The conference will be a three-days hybrid format and will include in-person attendance as well as a digital platform, allowing for greater participation from Madagascar and from across the world.
